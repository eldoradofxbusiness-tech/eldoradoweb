        ElDoradoFx is built around a single principle: risk comes first, always.
        We don't promise outcomes. We define a clear framework for how we analyze markets,
        manage exposure, and make decisions.

            How we operate

          <Text muted class="mb-6">
            Every signal, every trade, every decision follows a defined process.
            We don't react to emotions. We execute based on logic, structure, and predefined rules.

          <Text muted>
            The goal is not frequency — it's consistency. Not excitement — it's discipline.
            Capital preservation matters more than any individual result.

            We don't promise returns. We don't guarantee wins. We don't operate on hunches
            or market noise. We don't overtrade or overexpose.

            If a setup doesn't meet our risk criteria, we simply don't trade.
            The market doesn't care about our opinions — only structure matters.

        Two styles allow flexibility across market conditions.
        When scalping conditions weaken, swing setups may be clearer — and vice versa.
        This isn't about hedging. It's about structural adaptability.
