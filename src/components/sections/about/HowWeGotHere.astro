          ElDoradoFx wasn’t built overnight.
          It’s the result of years spent observing markets,
          making mistakes, refining execution,
          and understanding that survival always comes before profit.
        </Text>

        <Text muted class="leading-relaxed">
          We’ve traded through different market cycles,
          different conditions, and different emotional states.
          What remained constant was the need for structure,
          discipline, and defined risk.
