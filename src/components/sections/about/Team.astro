        Two professional traders with distinct execution styles.
        One scalps shorter timeframes. One trades swing setups.
        Both follow the same risk-first mindset.

            Focuses on multi-day positions based on higher timeframe structure.
            Less frequent, more patient. Risk is always defined before entry.
            Process over impulse.

        Two styles allow flexibility across market conditions.
        When scalping conditions weaken, swing setups may be clearer — and vice versa.
        This isn't about hedging. It's about structural adaptability.
